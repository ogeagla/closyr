# closyr

![icon_v3_qtr.png](resources%2Ficons%2Ficon_v3_qtr.png)

A Symbolic Regression tool, written in Clojure.

- Draw an objective function or select a built-in dataset
- Select number of points, iterations
- See progress 
  - Chart of best fitting function
  - Chart of loss over time
  - A selectable text version of the function

## Installation

Currently this application is not packed, so you have to run it from source, using Clojure development tools (`leiningen`)

    $ lein deps

## Usage

There are 3 options.


### Lein Run

    
    $ lein run

Or headless (just in the terminal), where you can specify options and input data:

    $ lein run -t -p 25 -i 5 -x 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 -y 1,2,30,4,5,6,10

Which is the same as:

    $ lein run --headless --population 1000 --iterations 200 --xs 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 --ys 1,2,30,4,5,6,10 

###  In Clojure REPL


    (require '[closyr.symreg :as symreg]) 
    (symreg/run-app-with-gui)

### Build and run JAR


    $ lein uberjar
    $ java -jar target/uberjar/closyr-0.1.0-standalone.jar

You can also provide the same command-line options to `java` command, like:

    $ java -jar target/uberjar/closyr-0.1.0-standalone.jar -t -p 25 -i 5 -x 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 -y 1,2,30,4,5,6,10

### Tests

    $ lein test

Coverage looks like this:

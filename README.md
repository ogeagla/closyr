![icon_v4_qtr.png](resources%2Ficons%2Ficon_v4_qtr.png)

A Symbolic Regression tool, written in Clojure.

Warning: This is experimental software, with an unstable API. Expect breaking changes prior to a major release.

- Draw an objective function or select a built-in dataset
- Select number of points, iterations
- See progress 
  - Chart of best fitting function
  - Chart of loss over time
  - A selectable text version of the function

## Installation

Currently this application is not packaged, so you have to run it from source, using Clojure development tools (`leiningen`)

    $ lein deps

## Usage

Use the application via GUI or in the terminal. 

There are 3 options.


### Lein Run

    
    $ lein run

Or headless (just in the terminal), where you can specify options and input data:

    $ lein run -t -p 25 -i 5 -x 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 -y 1,2,30,4,5,6,10

Which is the same as:

    $ lein run --headless --population 1000 --iterations 200 --xs 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 --ys 1,2,30,4,5,6,10 

###  In Clojure REPL


    (require '[closyr.symreg :as symreg]) 
    (symreg/run-app-with-gui)

### Build and run JAR


    $ lein uberjar
    $ java -jar target/uberjar/closyr-0.1.0-standalone.jar

You can also provide the same command-line options to `java` command, like:

    $ java -jar target/uberjar/closyr-0.1.0-standalone.jar -t -p 25 -i 5 -x 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 -y 1,2,30,4,5,6,10

## Examples

On successful application start, you should see this:

While a function search is running:

## Tests

    $ lein test

Coverage looks like this if you run `lein cloverage`:

## How It Works

- We use Genetic Algorithms to allow candidate functions of best fit to compete.
- They compete on a computed score on the input data, and we use the sum of residuals to generate the score.
- Evolution consists of mutation and crossover. 
- Mutations act on the function's AST and modify branches, leafs, or the whole tree.  Operations like `+0.1`, `*x`, `/Sin(x)` are applied to functions.
- Crossovers combine two functions' ASTs at a random point, and combine using various operators like `+`, and `*`.

## Roadmap

- [ ] CLI options accept a CSV file (GUI already supports this)
- [ ] More tests
- [ ] A different frontend.  The current Java Swing frontend does the job, but it's not easy to maintain and it's hard to make look better.
- [ ] Can this be a follow-up to this issue, asking for a symbolic regression tool on the JVM? https://github.com/axkr/symja_android_library/issues/850
- [ ] When I created this and my other symbolic regression tools, I didn't know about the formal field of symbolic regression.  I've since found some great libraries that I should review and apply the lessons to this project: https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR


## Credits

- This project would not have been possible without the symbolic math library `Symja` (https://github.com/axkr/symja_android_library), which has been great to use and I consider it to be like a `MathJs` (https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs) on the JVM.
